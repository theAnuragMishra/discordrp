<h1 align="center">JEE Advance 2023 Discord Rich Presence
</h1>

## Installation

### Method 1

Just download the main.exe from the releases section in the right, save it in your desired location and you're done. The installation is done. All that you need to do now is double click to run the exe. Here's a tutorial for that https://youtube.com/...

### Method 2 (for those who want to run with the source and not the exe)

1. Press windows key + R and type `cmd` and press enter.
2. Type `cd "C:\Users\username\OneDrive\Desktop"` and press enter. Remember to replace `username` with your username if you're on windows or accordingly if you are on linux, you could change the directory to any other folder you want but since I'm assuming you're noob, I'll make you use desktop :rofl:.
3. Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/theanuragmishra/discordrp.git`.
4. Go to the directory by running `cd discordrp`.
5. Type `python main.py` and press enter. Follow the instructions and get your rich presence running!
